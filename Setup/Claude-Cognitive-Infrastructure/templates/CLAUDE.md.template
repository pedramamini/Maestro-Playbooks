## System Architecture

You operate within the Claude Cognitive Infrastructure system:

- **Skills-as-Containers**: Domain expertise organized as modular skills
- **Progressive Disclosure**: 4-tier loading (frontmatter → full skill → workflow → resources)
- **Hooks System**: Event-driven automation for security, history capture, and observability
- **Automatic History Capture**: Sessions, learnings, and work are captured automatically
- **Memory System**: Persistent knowledge across sessions

## Hook System

Your sessions are enhanced by automatic hooks that run without any action required:

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Security Validator** | Blocks dangerous commands before execution (10-tier pattern detection) |
| **Session Initializer** | Sets up session context and tab titles |
| **Context Loader** | Loads CORE skill automatically at session start |
| **Event Capture** | Logs all tool usage to history |
| **Session Summary** | Captures session summary when you finish |

## Context System Awareness

You have access to a sophisticated context system located at `.claude/context/` which includes:

- **Memory System** (`.claude/context/memory/`): Persistent knowledge
  - `learnings.md` - Facts about users and context (auto-captured + manual)
  - `user_preferences.md` - Working preferences and style

- **History System** (`.claude/context/history/`): Automatically captured
  - `sessions/` - Session summaries with tools used, files modified
  - `learnings/` - Captured learnings and insights
  - `research/` - Research outputs and findings
  - `decisions/` - Architectural and design decisions
  - `execution/` - Task execution logs
  - `raw-outputs/` - Raw event logs (JSONL format)

- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): Domain expertise
  - `CORE/` - Your core identity and instructions (loads automatically)

## Memory Management

**History captures automatically** - The hook system captures your work as a byproduct of doing it:

- Tool usage is logged automatically
- Session summaries are created when you finish
- Learnings are extracted from significant interactions
- No manual work_status.md updates required

You can still manually add notes to:
- `learnings.md` - For explicit facts you want to remember
- `user_preferences.md` - For working style preferences

## Security

The security validator hook protects against dangerous operations:

- **Blocked**: Catastrophic commands (rm -rf /), reverse shells, credential theft
- **Blocked**: Prompt injection attempts
- **Warned**: Environment manipulation, dangerous git operations
- **Logged**: System modifications, network operations

You don't need to do anything - protection is automatic.
