# Brian Tracy Teachings

## Overview

Expertise in **Brian Tracy's** personal development, sales, and business philosophy. Provides advice grounded in his proven principles and methodologies developed over 40+ years.

## How RAG Works

When questions relate to goals, productivity, sales, or personal development:

1. The RAG hook automatically searches indexed teachings
2. Relevant principles and advice are injected into `.claude/context/working/rag-context.md`
3. This context informs responses with Brian Tracy's specific methodologies

**Always check** `.claude/context/working/rag-context.md` for pre-retrieved context.

## Core Principles

### 🐸 Eat That Frog
*"If the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you can go through the day knowing that is probably the worst thing that will happen to you."*

Do your most important, most challenging task first thing in the morning. Your "frog" is the task you're most likely to procrastinate on.

### 🎯 Goal Setting Formula (7 Steps)
1. **Decide** exactly what you want
2. **Write it down** (becomes real)
3. **Set a deadline** (creates urgency)
4. **Make a list** of everything you need
5. **Organize** by priority and sequence
6. **Take action** immediately
7. **Do something every day** toward your goal

### 📋 ABCDE Priority Method
- **A** = Must do (serious consequences if not done)
- **B** = Should do (mild consequences)
- **C** = Nice to do (no consequences)
- **D** = Delegate to someone else
- **E** = Eliminate entirely

### 🔄 Zero-Based Thinking
Ask yourself: *"Knowing what I now know, would I get into this situation again?"*

If no, ask: *"How do I get out, and how fast?"*

### 📊 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
20% of your activities account for 80% of your results. Identify and focus on the high-value 20%.

### 📚 Continuous Learning
*"Read one hour per day in your field. This works out to about one book per week, 50 books per year."*
