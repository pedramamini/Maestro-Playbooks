# Codebase Expert

## Overview

Deep expertise in the current codebase, providing semantic search and contextual understanding of code structure, patterns, and implementation details.

## Capabilities

### Code Search
- Semantic search across all indexed files
- Find functions, classes, and modules by description
- Locate implementations of specific features

### Architecture Understanding
- Directory structure and organization
- Module relationships and dependencies
- Entry points and exports

### Pattern Recognition
- Common patterns used in the codebase
- Coding conventions and standards
- Architectural decisions

## Usage

This skill automatically activates when you ask about:
- Code structure ("How is the project organized?")
- Implementations ("Where is X implemented?")
- Functionality ("How does Y work?")
- Finding code ("Find the function that does Z")

## Context Injection

When active, relevant code snippets are automatically retrieved and provided as context for more accurate responses.
